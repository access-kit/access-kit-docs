So, as artists, designers, and programmers ourselves, we were looking for ways to expand the reach of art and media presented at cultural institutions. We felt that solving the challenges of providing synchronized, accessible, real-time captions and audio was a great way to do this!

And so, accesskit was born out of the idea that these two problems could be solved through unified solutions."}),(0,o.jsx)("p",{className:"mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-blueGray-500",children:"Patrick is a software engineer and writer, while Sam is a technology consultant for artists and galleries.
